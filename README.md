## qmrExchange Overview
The qmrExchange project is an open-source financial markets exchange simulator that realistically mimics all the main components of modern trading venues. It allows us to test and quantify the behavior of different agents in a laboratory and isolated environment without the high noise-to-signal ratio that is otherwise unavoidable in live settings.
By creating a completely functioning trading venue whose access is only granted to a finite and known number of agents or trading algorithms, qmrExchange enables analyzing causation and quantifying the impact of each agent in a way that is otherwise unfeasible.


## Use cases for qmrExchange
The implementation of qmrExchange closely resembles the backend of most FIFO trading exchanges and replicates the market microstructure of the most popular venues. As a consequence, the system is especially useful for:
- Teaching, studying, and researching topics related to market microstructure and algorithmic trading.
- Estimating the impact of new regulations and how they affect each type of agent
- Implementing and analyzing market-making and high-frequency trading algorithms
-	Creating algorithmic trading challenges and tournaments both for university students and industry professionals alike


## Potential Research Topics with qmrExchange
Due to its precise resemblance to real-life trading venues, qmrExchange is perfectly suited for researching plenty of topics, such as:
### Market-Making Algorithms
By implementing a finite number of market participants, such as institutional investors and indicator-based trading algorithms, market-making algorithms can be studied. For a rigorous implementation, refer to Avellaneda & Stoikov (2008)
### Optimal Execution Algorithms
qmrExchange is an ideal environment for implementing, testing, and quantifying the market impact of different execution algorithms. By creating a laboratory, sterile and isolated venue whose market participants and their behavior is known with absolute certainty, optimal execution algorithms can be easily implemented, researched, and calibrated. For a formal presentation of such an algorithm, refer to Almgren & Chriss (1999).
### Adversarial Algorithms
Much like in the spirit of General Adversarial Networks and Game Theory, an implementation where a profit-maximizing agent‚Äôs behavior is calibrated based on the predefined behavior of other market participants is possible. For an interesting introduction to game theory applied to financial markets, refer to Allen & Morris (2022).

## Basig usage of qmrExchange
### Import required libraries

```python
from source.qmr_exchange import Exchange
from random import Random
from source.qmr_exchange import Exchange, Simulator
from source.agents import RandomMarketTaker, NaiveMarketMaker
from datetime import datetime
```

### Declare basic parameters for the simulation
qmrExchange allows for simulating multiple tickers at once, for statistical arbitrage and high-frequency-trading simulations. In the present case, we simulate 2 weeks worth of 1 minute data (24/7 trading).

```python
from_date = datetime(2022,1,1)
to_date = datetime(2022,1,15)
time_interval = 'minute'
tickers = ['XYZ']
```

### Instantiate a Simulator

```python
sim = Simulator(from_date, to_date,time_interval)
sim.exchange.create_asset(tickers[0])
```

### Add trading agents
We can add a naive market maker that creates both buy and sell orders in each period. It quotes buy and sell prices based on the last traded price and the specified spread percentage.


```python
mm = NaiveMarketMaker(name='market_maker', tickers=tickers, aum=1_000, spread_pct=0.005, qty_per_order=4)
sim.add_agent(mm)
``` 

As our market counter-parts, we can either use naive market taker that randomly buys and sells (based on the defined probabilities) on each period by means of market ordes (hence the word 'taker').

```python
mt = RandomMarketTaker(name='market_taker', tickers=tickers, aum=1_000, prob_buy=.2, prob_sell=.2, qty_per_order=1,seed=42)
sim.add_agent(mt)
```

Or a 'smart' market taker, that uses a predefined trading strategy to buy and sell. In the present case, we use a simple moving average crossover strategy.

```python
from source.strategies import MovingAverageCrossover
from source.agents import SmartMarketTaker

strategy = MovingAverageCrossover(short_window=5, long_window=20)
smt = SmartMarketTaker(name='smart_market_taker', tickers=tickers, aum=1_000, strategy=strategy, qty_per_order=1, seed=42)
sim.add_agent(smt)
```

### Run the simulation

```python
sim.run()
```

Retrieve all executed trades of our simulation

```python
sim.trades
```

Plot the assets under management of each agent

```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df_plot = pd.DataFrame()
df_plot['Market Maker'] = mm_holdings['aum']
df_plot['Market Taker'] = mt_holdings['aum']
fig = px.line(df_plot,labels={'variable':'Agents','value':'Assets Under Management','dt':'Date'})
fig.show()
```
